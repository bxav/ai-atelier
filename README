# Xav'AI Lab Monorepo

Welcome to my AI Lab, an open-source initiative where I'm building a suite of tools and applications with a focus on AI technologies and SaaS solutions. This repository is structured to manage a diverse set of applications and packages, including AI-driven chatbots, utility libraries, and user interfaces for various microSaaS platforms.

## Structure

The monorepo is divided into two main directories:

- `/apps` - Contains all the individual applications, such as web applications, APIs, and CLIs related to my projects.
- `/packages` - Houses shared libraries and utilities that provide common functionality across the applications.

## Applications

- `ai-lab-api` - The backend API for the AI Lab, offering endpoints for AI operations.
- `ai-lab-cli` - A command-line toolkit to manage AI Lab resources and tasks.
- `assistants` - Interactive assistant applications designed for user engagement through conversational interfaces.
- `playground` - An interactive environment for real-time experimentation with various LLMs, offering features to save and share presets for AI models.

## Packages

- `app-assistants` - Shared modules tailored for the assistant applications.
- `app-playground` - Common code that underpins the functionality within the playground apps.
- `kit-chatbot` - A robust chatbot kit featuring both client and server-side components.
- `shared-ai-models-config` - Configurations and models for AI services that I use across my applications.
- `ui-components` - A library of basic UI components that are reusable in multiple projects.
- `ui-saas-components` - Specialized UI components developed for my microSaaS applications.
- `ui-utils` - Utility functions that support the development of user interfaces.

## Getting Started

To dive into the [My Project Name] monorepo, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Nx](https://nx.dev/) installed on your system.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to the repository directory
cd [repository-directory-name]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve a development version of an application
nx serve [app-name]

# Build a production version of an application
nx build [app-name]
```

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the `README.md` file within the specific app or package directory you're interested in running or developing.
